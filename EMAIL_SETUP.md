# Application URL (used for links in emails, e.g., to admin panel)
# For local development, usually http://localhost:3000
# For production, your actual deployed application URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-domain.com

# Email Configuration (optional, but recommended for production)

# The "From" address for emails sent via Resend.
# If not set, API routes will default to "Wholesale System <onboarding@resend.dev>".
# For production, it's highly recommended to use a custom domain verified with Resend (e.g., "noreply@yourdomain.com").
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL="Wholesale System <noreply@yourdomain.com>"

# The email address that receives admin notifications for new orders.
# This is mandatory for admin notifications to be sent.
